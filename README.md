E2D-Spriter
===========

This is a program made using python and pygame to simplify the task of making sprites. It uses its own GUI Library, and is currently in active development by me.

Goals
=====

As this project is still in development, I have some simple goals I have planned out in order to have something realistic happening:

-The Program will allow you to use your own brushes to paint, or use a default pixel brush
-The Program will have a random pallette in which no 2 colors are the same.
-The Program will allow you to have frames, be able to cycle through them and allow you to edit and export them as a list of png files.
-The Program will allow the use of templates, most likely, on which you can use "wax paper" to form your own sprite upon
-The Program will have its own GUI Library that will most likely be distributed along with it

Final Goal: I wish to have this project completed by the end of April 2013, unless time constraints occur, in which case the project will finish by End of May 2013.


What and Who I am Looking for
=============================

I am looking for people with experience with pygame, and especially GUI and algorithims, such as the flood fill. I have already made various paint-like programs but I require assistance in order to make zooming in function properly as it is very destructive in pygame when you resize a surface.
